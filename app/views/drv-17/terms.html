          <p><strong>LAND REGISTRY REGISTER VIEW SERVICE</strong></p>
          <p><strong>What is the Register View Service? </strong></p>
          <p>If you&rsquo;re buying or selling a house or are just interested in a property the Land Registry Register View service is an on-line service that will enable you to see a summary of a title.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The summary is a cut down version of the information Land Registry holds about a property.&nbsp; It tells you the owners name and address; what they paid for the property if they purchased after April 2000 (you will not get the price paid for the property if they purchased before April 2000, or no money changed hands or the owner did not buy the property outright); if there is a mortgage on the property the Lender&rsquo;s name and address; if it is a leasehold property how long the lease is for and the rough extent and location of the property.</p>
          <p>You will be able to view the information on screen.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll only be able to view it once you&rsquo;ll need to print it out or take a screen shot.</p>
          <p>The summary of the register you will see will be a summary of the register at the time and date of your transaction.&nbsp; The Land Registry system is a live system that is updated as applications are submitted to Land Registry are processed so the information on a register summary is subject to change.</p>
          <p><strong>When not to use the Register View Service </strong></p>
          <p>If more detailed information is required such as the full legal register entry; details of access rights, rights of way and restrictions; documents to prove who owns a property for example in a court case or for a visa application; the official title plan showing indicative boundaries; a copy of the deeds or details of previous owners then you will need to use a different service for this detailed information.</p>
